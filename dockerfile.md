## Dockerfile for Packaging a Java Application

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8u151-jdk-alpine3.7

# Expose port 8070 to allow communication with the application
EXPOSE 8070

# Set the environment variable APP_HOME
ENV APP_HOME /usr/src/app

# Copy the application JAR file to the container's APP_HOME directory
COPY target/shopping-cart-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar $APP_HOME/app.jar

# Set the working directory to APP_HOME
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# Specify the command to run when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT exec java -jar app.jar
```

This Dockerfile is designed to package a Java application into a Docker image. It uses the `openjdk:8u151-jdk-alpine3.7` base image, exposes port `8070` for communication, and sets up the application's environment and entry point. The JAR file `shopping-cart-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` is copied into the container's `APP_HOME` directory, and the Java application is executed using the `java -jar` command.

This Dockerfile provides a streamlined way to containerize and deploy your Java application within a Docker container.
Feel free to use this markdown content in your documentation or wherever you need to explain and showcase the provided Dockerfile.
