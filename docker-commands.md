# Docker Basic Commands and Usage

Docker is a powerful platform that simplifies application deployment using containers. Here are some essential Docker commands to help you get started:

## 1. Build an Image

To create a Docker image from a Dockerfile, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <image_name> <path_to_dockerfile>
```

Replace `<image_name>` with the desired name for your image and `<path_to_dockerfile>` with the path to your Dockerfile. The `-t` flag tags the image for easy reference.

## 2. Tag an Image

You can assign additional tags to an existing image using:

```bash
docker tag <image_name> <new_tag>
```

Replace `<image_name>` with the name or ID of the image you want to tag and `<new_tag>` with the new tag you want to assign.

## 3. Push an Image to a Docker Registry

Once your image is ready, you can push it to a Docker registry with:

```bash
docker push <image_name>
```

Ensure you're logged in to the Docker registry using `docker login` before pushing.

## 4. Run a Docker Container

To run a Docker container from an image, use:

```bash
docker run <image_name>
```

This starts a container based on the specified image. For more advanced configurations, you can use flags like `-p` to map ports, `-v` for volumes, and `-e` for environment variables. For example:

```bash
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> -v <host_path>:<container_path> -e KEY=VALUE <image_name>
```

Remember, these commands are introductory. Docker offers a wide range of options and configurations for more complex use cases. For comprehensive information and examples tailored to your needs, refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
